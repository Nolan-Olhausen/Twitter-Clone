## Database Schema

The Twitter clone uses a MySQL database to manage all user and application data. Below is an overview of the key tables, their purposes, and relationships:

#### Key Tables

1. **`users`**
   - Stores user data such as email, username, password, profile image, bio, and access level.
   - Each user has a unique ID.

2. **`posts`**
   - Contains posts created by users, including the `posted_time`.
   - Each post is linked to its author (`user_id`).

3. **`postContent`**
   - Stores the text and/or image associated with posts.
   - Linked to the `posts` table by `post_id`.

4. **`likes`**
   - Tracks user interactions (likes) on posts.
   - Links users (`user_id`) to liked posts (`post_id`).

5. **`comments`**
   - Stores comments made on posts, along with the comment text and timestamp.
   - Links each comment to a user (`user_id`) and a post (`post_id`).

6. **`replies`**
   - Tracks replies to comments.
   - Links replies to a specific comment (`comment_id`) and the replying user (`user_id`).

7. **`follow`**
   - Manages follow relationships between users.
   - Tracks the `sender` (follower) and `receiver` (followee) with timestamps.

8. **`messages`**
   - Stores direct messages exchanged between users, including the message content and timestamp.
   - Links messages to the sender (`messageFrom`) and receiver (`messageTo`).

9. **`notifications`**
   - Tracks events such as follows, likes, retweets, quotes, comments, replies, and mentions.
   - Includes details about the target user (`notify_for`), triggering user (`notify_from`), and the event type.

10. **`echoes`**
    - Manages retweets and quote retweets, linking them to the original post and additional message text, if any.
    - Allows recursive references for nested retweets using `echo_id`.

#### Relationships

- **`users`** is the central table, with foreign keys linking it to almost all other tables (`posts`, `likes`, `comments`, `follows`, etc.).
- Posts and their related content (likes, comments, retweets) cascade changes to maintain consistency when a post is deleted or updated.
- Notifications provide insights into interactions, while messages facilitate direct communication between users.

#### Database Schema File

For a detailed SQL implementation of the schema, refer to the [`nolhausen.sql`](https://github.com/Nolan-Olhausen/Twitter-Clone/blob/main/src/nolhausen.sql) file in the repository.

## Screenshots

Here are some screenshots showcasing the core features of the Twitter clone:

### 1. Home Feed
The main timeline displaying posts from followed users and yourself. 
Note: This screenshot also displays how "retweets" (echoes in my implementation) look in the feed, with the top post being a quote "retweet".
